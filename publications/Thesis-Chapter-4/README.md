# Optimising deep learning models for prediction of dry matter content in mango fruit with an extensive multi-population, multi-instrument spectral dataset

This repository accompanies Chapter 4 in the submitted thesis of Jeremy Walsh, 2024, Central Queensland University, "**[Deep Learning In Estimation of Fruit Attributes Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy](https://acquire.cqu.edu.au/articles/thesis/Deep_Learning_in_Estimation_of_Fruit_Attributes_Using_Near_Infrared_Spectroscopy/27208401?file=49736973)**". 

The code within this repository was as described in the methodology in the aforementioned thesis chapter. Computational analyses and modelling tasks were carried out on a laptop equipped with a 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1265U processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a shared Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics GPU, running Windows 10 Enterprise. Optuna optimisation studies were executed on a separate workstation featuring a 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i9-12950HX processor, 64 GB of RAM, and a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, operating on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. The software environment for both setups was based on Python 3.10, and the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file specifies all necessary Python packages and libraries, along with their respective versions.

The extensive mango dry matter and near-infrared spectra dataset used in this study is published on Mendeley Data, accessible at:  [data.mendeley.com/datasets/46htwnp833/4](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/46htwnp833/4).
